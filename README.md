# "Super Sweet 16" 16-step knob-per-function sequencer Module for eurorack
For a while now I've been looking for a through hole diy eurorack sequencer that is as hands-on as the Baby8 but with comfort features 
you would maybe not have with an analog/cmos design. The outcome of my struggle is this module. It is a 16-step sequencer with the following functions:
- variable sequence length up to 16 steps
- Cascading (meaning you can connect multiple to get 32/48/etc steps)
- Builtin quantizer with multiple scales (off, chromatic, major, minor, blues, pentatonic)
- Holding or pausing notes
- 2 x Gate and CV out
- splittable (meaning you can have 2 channels for sequence lengths lower than 8)

## Status - First revision comfirmed working, second revision has some improvements but not explicitly tested, software almost done (cascading is not implemented yet)
